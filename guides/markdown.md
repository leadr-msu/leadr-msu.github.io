# Headings
To make headings, start the line with a hash #. The more #, the smaller the header. Be sure to put a space between the # and the word.

For Example:
# Header
One #

## Header
Two ##

### Header
Three ###

#### Header
Four ####

## Emphasis
To create bold text, wrap text with two astericks (**) or two underscores (__) on each side.

To creat italic text, wrap text with one asterick (*) or two underscores (__) on each side.

## Links
Links can either be inline with the text, or placed at the bottom of the text as references. Link text is enclosed by square brackets [], and for inline links, the link URL is inclosed by the parens ().

`[ text ](webaddress)`

##Images
Images are almost identical to links, but an image starts with and exclamation point (!)

`!(leadr.png)`

## Blockquotes
To creat a blockquote, start a line with a greater than > followed by an optional space.

Blockquotes can also be nested using multiple greater than signs and can contain other formating

>First Line - one > sign
>>Second Line - two > signs
>>>Third Line - three > signs

## Lists
Unordered lists can use either astericks (*), plus (+) or hypens (-) as list markers followed by a space before the text.

* Astericks
+ Plus sign
- Hypens

Ordered lists use numbers followed by a period.

1. Number 1
2. Number 2

## Nested Lists
To nest one list within another, indent each item in the sublist by four spaces. You can also nest other elements like paragraphs, blockquotes or code blocks.
* Item
    1. First Subitem
    2. Second Subitem
* Item
    - Subitem
    - Subitem
* Item

# For showing code or markdown
`To make your code appear like this ` encase your text/code with backticks (`) one on each side
